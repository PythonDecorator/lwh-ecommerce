                    <p>Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective,
                        damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it

                    <p>
                        We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund
                        was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment
                        method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process
